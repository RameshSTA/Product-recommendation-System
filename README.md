The dataset has to be accessed from the  folder where the dataset has been saved. After the sentiment analysis and cleaning of the dataset, new clean data set is prepared which is also saved in same directory, so that we can access for the prodcut recommendation.

For the execution of the project, we have to setup the virtual environment and  install all the dependencies  from teh requirements.
